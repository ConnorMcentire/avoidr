avoidr
======

collision avoidance game written in pygame

# nexts steps:
(0) detect the size of the monitor, make all spatial variables relative to variable screen size
(1) add border collision detection
(2) add moving obstacles
(3) the background should be a random color on every frame redraw (or how many frames to skip?)
(4) the player character will always be the inverted color of the background (invert RGB values from background)
(5) add collision with moving obstacles
(6) decide what colors/shapes/movement-patterns the obstacles will have
(7) create a level engine/editor
(8) create difficulty modes
